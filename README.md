# Notekeeper_pluralsight_aad
During **ALC 3.1**, I was able to build the app with the help of Jim Wilson on **PluralSight Associate Android Developer Path course**. The app is a note-keeping app that can store the progress of each course taking. The app can show alarm message or notification to remind someone those course at a particular time. It has _nice_ UI/UX.



## Screenshots of the App
